## Modern Deep Learning Techniques Applied to Natural Language Processing
This book project contains an overview of recent trends in deep learning based natural language processing (NLP). It covers the theoretical concepts and implementation details behind deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and reinforcement learning, used to solve various NLP tasks. The overview also contains a summary of state of the art results for NLP tasks such as *machine translation*, *question answering*, and *dialogue systems*. You can find the learning resource at the following address: [https://nlpoverview.com/](https://nlpoverview.com/). A snapshot of the website is provided below:

## About this project
The main motivations for this project are as follows:
- Maintain an up-to-date learning resource that integrates important information related to NLP research, such as:
    - state of the art results
    - emerging concepts and models
    - new benchmark datasets
    - code/dataset releases
    - etc.
- Create a friendly and open resource to help guide researchers and anyone interested to learn about modern techniques applied to NLP
- A collaborative project where expert researchers can suggest changes (e.g., incorporate SOTA results) based on their recent findings and experimental results
